    "It's always good to remember that data doesn't arrive in a format suitable for model training. In the initial contact between a data professional and the data itself, a cleaning process is always necessary because the so-called raw data can lead to inefficient models. However, any strategy for editing/deleting or creating data within a set should be done with the premise that the solution to the business problem will not be affected - This is the basis of Feature Engineering."
